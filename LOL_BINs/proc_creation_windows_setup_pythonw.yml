id: 6c6b0b7a-481d-4aca-84be-963e6cd2e302
description: Detects the execution of malicious Python scripts from the AppData directory after the execution of the setup.exe installation package.

A malicious actor could modify these scripts or add their own to execute malicious actions after the legitimate software is installed.
